<h3><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Announcement: Change 
  to mouse functioning</font> </h3>
<h3>Previously in VPython:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> the left mouse button was used to zoom into and out of the scene</li>
  <li>the right mouse button was used to rotate the camera</li>
</ul>
<p>This required dragging with the left button up, which is unusual.</p>
<h3>Starting with Python 2.2, this functioning of VPython has been changed to:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>hold down both mouse buttons to zoom (or the middle button or &quot;wheel&quot;)</li>
  <li>the right mouse button is used to rotate the camera, as before</li>
</ul>
<p>This permits dragging with the left button down, as in most applications.</p>
