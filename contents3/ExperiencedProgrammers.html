<p><strong>HOW PYTHON IS DIFFERENT</strong> (back to <a href="index3.html">home
    page</a>) <br />
  Comments for those with prior programming experience<br />

<p>In many respects Python is like any other algorithmic programming language
  (C, Pascal, Java, etc.) and unlike, say, Lisp. There are a few features of
  Python that an experienced programmer doesn't expect because they are embedded
  in a seemingly familiar environment yet are quite different from most algorithmic
  languages. This document attempts to point out the most important ones.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAMIC TYPING</strong><br />
  When you say &quot;z1 = Zork(cost=23)&quot; you create a Zork object and stick
  a label on it, &quot;z1&quot;. There is no need (and no way) to declare &quot;z1&quot;  to
  be of type &quot;Zork&quot; before labeling this instance of the class  &quot;Zork&quot; with
the label &quot;z1&quot;.</p>
<p>If you now say &quot;z2 = z1&quot; you have not created any new object, you
  have merely stuck a second label &quot;z2&quot; on the existing Zork object.
  Note carefully that this does NOT create a second instance of the class  &quot;Zork&quot;.
  If you alter z1.cost it is just the same as altering z2.cost. Making a second,
  independent copy of an object is a fairly unusual thing to do in Python, but
  there exist special methods for doing this.</p>
<p>If you now say &quot;z1 = 3.7&quot; the label &quot;z1&quot; no longer refers
  to the Zork object, and a reference counter on the Zork object is decremented.
  You can still refer to the object with expressions such as &quot;z2.cost&quot;.
  If you then say &quot;z2 = 28.7/3.4&quot; there is no longer any way to refer
  to the Zork object. The Zork object reference count is decremented again, to
  zero, and the object is now marked as eligible to be deleted by the garbage
  collection routine, since there is no longer any way to refer to it.</p>
<p>Special case for VPython: Humanly visible objects such as boxes or spheres
  in a graphics scene have an extra reference count so that even if there are
  no labels on these objects, they are not deletable because a human viewer counts
  as a reference. To delete a visual object it is first necessary to set the
  visible attribute to False.</p>
<p><strong>MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE</strong><br />
  An important Python structure is a list: mylist = [3, 'dog', 4.7, Zork(cost=23),
    box()]. The 'dog' in this list can be referred to as mylist[1], the elements
    being numbered starting with zero. If you say mylist[1] = 42 you've changed
    'dog' to 42 in the list. The ability to change elements in a list means that
lists are  &quot;mutable&quot;.</p>
<p>A different list-like structure is a tuple: mytup = (3, 'dog', 4.7) is created
  using parens instead of square brackets. You can read an element, so mytup[1]
  refers to 'dog', but you cannot change an element. A tuple is  &quot;immutable&quot;.
  The only way to achieve the effect is something like this:&nbsp; mytup = (mytup[0],
  42, mytup[2]), which creates a new tuple.</p>
<p>Lists and tuples are examples of what are called &quot;sequences&quot; in
  Python. A third important kind of sequence is a dictionary, which is a container
  of elements with keywords, and you index in not by position but by keyword
  (as a string).</p>
<p><strong>&quot;FOR&quot; LOOPS</strong><br />
  A particularly delightful and powerful feature of Python is that you can loop
    over any sequence. Suppose for example you have created objects for the planets.
You can loop over them like this:</p>
<p>for planet in [Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
  Pluto]:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print planet.pos,
  planet.mass, planet.radius</p>
<p>This could also be written like this:</p>
<p>planets = [Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
  Pluto]<br />
  for planet in planets:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print planet.pos,
  planet.mass, planet.radius</p>
<p><strong>INTEGER DIVISION</strong><br />
  As in many languages including C, 3/4 normally evaluates as zero rather than
    0.75. There is a slow migration path for Python eventually to treat 3/4 as
    0.75 rather than zero. You can invoke this behavior now by making the following
statement the first statement in the program:</p>
<p>from&nbsp; __future__&nbsp;  import division</p>
<p>Note carefully that there are TWO underlines before &quot;future&quot; and
  TWO underlines after &quot;future&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>IDLE VS SHELL</strong><br />
  If you run Python directly, or operate in the &quot;shell&quot; window of IDLE,
  the editor that comes with Python, you can execute statements interactively.
Many experienced programmers find this a useful mode.</p>
<p>Some people much prefer to write whole programs, even small ones, because
  it is easier to revise and easier to understand what state of module import
  one is in. There are two features in IDLE that can be set in the Configure
  IDLE menu option (if not already set at install time) which make edit/compile/run/revise
  cycles almost as immediate as the shell window. One feature is to specify that
  whenever you press F5 to run, the current version of your file is automatically
  saved to disk (&quot;autosave&quot;; note that there is nearly infinite un-do
  available). The other is an option to specify that at startup IDLE should open
  an edit window rather than the shell window (you can always open a shell window
  later, and one is created when you run a program, because that's where text
  output goes). The first time you press F5 to run, you will be asked to specify
  where to save the file, but with autosave turned on you won't be asked again.</p>
<p>The effect is that when you start IDLE you're ready to enter a program, and
  after the initial save, the programming cycle is extremely simple: just press
  F5 to save and run. One-touch testing.</p>
