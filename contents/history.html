      <p class="Normal"><strong>This is documentation for Classic VPython (VPython 6), which continues to be available but is no longer supported.

      <p class="Normal">Here is a log of changes to VPython since the initial release of  VPython 5 in December 2008, continuing with VPython 6, first released in February 2013.</p>
      <p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Normal">2016-01-25: See the important <a href="announcements/evolution.html" target="_blank"><strong>announcement</strong></a> on the future evolution of VPython.</p>
      <p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Normal">2015-01-12: VPython 6.11 corrects an error in setting the axis of an object, in which sometimes the orientation of the object would flip 180 degrees, most noticeably when setting the axis of a frame.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2014-07-11: VPython 6.10 introduces ways to delete displays and wxPython windows without ending the program, which lets you clear everything away and create new displays or windows. Suppose w = window() and d = display(window=w): then w.delete() deletes the wxPython window and all the widgets contained in that window, including the d display; d.delete() just deletes the display from the window it appears in unless d.window = None, in which case the entire window is deleted; window.delete_all(), not w.delete_all(), deletes all VPython windows and displays. Moreover, w.cursor.visible or d.cursor.visible can now be set to True or False (only d.cursor.visible works on a Macintosh). You can now specify a window style when creating a wxPython window; see the example program widgets.py for an example. Something that was either a bug or a feature has been addressed: If you set shaftwidth to be nonzero for an arrow, you also had to set fixedwidth = True, which seemed awkward. Now when you set shaftwidth this automatically sets fixedwidth = True. If you set fixedwidth = False later in the program, you get the somewhat quirky behavior currently seen with this combination. Creation of displays or wxPython windows now checks for part of the area being off screen and decreases the width and/or height to make all of the area appear on screen. Setting scene.fullscreen = True now works properly (but is inactive on a Macintosh). Pressing CTRL while dragging the mouse now rotates the camera on all platforms. The statement exit() kills the program. Many bugs have been fixed; a list is available <strong><a href="https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-wx/issues?direction=desc&amp;page=1&amp;sort=updated&amp;state=closed" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. A history of source-code changes is available <strong><a href="https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-wx/commits/master" target="_blank">here</a></strong><a href="https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-wx/commits/master" target="_blank"></a>. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2013-04-20: VPython 6.05 released to fix  bugs and improve documentation.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2013-03-02: VPython 6.04 released to fix minor bugs and improve documentation.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2013-02-19: VPython 6.03 released by Bruce Sherwood and Steve Spicklemire. This version is based on the wxPython cross-platform GUI library, which has made possible the elimination of almost all platform-dependent code, and of the threading structure of VPython 5. Moreover, wxPython makes it possible for a window to contain a VPython 3D animation along with standard widgets such as buttons and sliders. VPython 5 on the Macintosh was based on the Carbon framework, which is no longer supported, whereas VPython 6 uses the supported Cocoa framework (through wxPython). VPython 6 includes improved mechanisms for handling mouse and keyboard events.      </p>

      <p class="Normal">2012-04-23: Visual 5.74 fixes a bug in the display of ellipsoids</p>
      <p class="Normal">2012-04-15: Visual 5.73 with minor bug fixes (controls module, text object).</p>
      <p class="Normal">2012-04-01: Aaron Mavrinac moved the VPython source files from the increasingly obsolete CVS-format repository at sourceforge.net to an up-to-date git repository at github.com.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-12-10: Rebuilt Visual 5.72 source package for Linux to replace a Linux routine that is broken on recent releases of Ubuntu and Debian (and probably Fedora). This fixes the crashes of Visual on Linux that happened with the simplest programs.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-10-24 Visual 5.72 rebuilt to include a patch by Jason Morgan to fix a bug in packaging materials when using py2exe.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-10-19 Visual 5.72: Corrects a bug in graphs where plotting (0,.001) followed by (.001,.001) failed to autoscale correctly. Also added documentation explaining what objects are used to represent gdots, gcurves, ghbars, and gvbars.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-05-06 Visual 5.71: Adds log-log and semilog plots to graphs, and the ability to offset the graph origin. Thanks to a diagnosis by David Scherer, random dots around the text of label objects (Windows and Linus) are (nearly) eliminated. A bug that occasionally prevented a graph from displaying has been fixed.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-03-27 Visual 5.70: Adds an easy to use way to <strong><a href="docs/trail.html">leave a trail</a></strong> behind a moving object.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-03-23 Visual 5.61: Adds mouse crosshairs to graphs, simplifies the use of controls (no need to call interact), fixes a long-standing inconsistency in the background of a label object's box, and fixes bugs in materials.bricks and in the checking for the presence of Polygon and font modules.</p>
<p class="Normal">2011-03-13 Visual 5.60: Add facilities to extract faces data from extrusion and text objects, and to make extrusion and text objects single-sided for speed. Kadir Haldenbilen contributed improved gear facilities to the shapes library, including rack gears.</p>
<p class="Normal">2011-03-01 Visual 5.51: Fix memory leak on Windows and Mac. Correct errors in assigning color and material to a text object. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2011-02-20 Visual 5.50 for all platforms introduces the powerful extrusion object developed by Kadir Haldenbilen and Bruce Sherwood. Included are shapes and paths libraries that simplify the creation of complex extrusions. Haldenbilen has also contributed new materials which can be viewed in the updated example program material_test.py. The curve object has been modified to be able to use the new shapes and paths libraries. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-12-02 Visual 5.41 for Windows, to fix bugs in active and passive stereo.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-11-22 Visual 5.4 package for Python 2.6 for Windows and Mac, which includes numpy 1.5.1. It was pointed out that there was no scipy module for Python 2.7 or Python 3.1, and the existing Visual 5.32 for Python 2.6 included numpy 1.3, whereas scipy now requires numpy 1.4.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-11-03 Visual 5.4 package for Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 for Linux. This package can presumably also be used to build on Python 3.1, but this would require building Boost libraries for Python 3.1, for which there may not be Linux packages.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-10-27 Visual 5.4 for Python 2.7 and Python 3.1, for Windows and Mac.This release includes a new module, &quot;vis&quot;, which permits selective import of Visual objects without the importing of math and numpy that is done for &quot;from visual import *&quot;. See the main page of the full documentation for details. The font modules included in this VPython installer have been updated to work with Python 3.1, but tested only to the extent that they work with VPython. It is quite possible that additional work is needed to make them fully functional with Python 3.1. Ned Deily fixed a problem with IDLE (and VIDLE) on Macs; it was recently noticed that quitting on the Mac did not prompt you to save unsaved code.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-09-14 Beta test version of Visual 5.32 for Python 3.1, currently only for Windows. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-09-04 Visual 5.32 for Python 2.7 rebuilt for Intel Mac to use production version of numpy 1.5.0..      </p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-08-31 Visual 5.32 for Python 2.7 rebuilt for Windows to use production version of numpy 1.5.0.      </p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-08-16 Visual 5.32 is now available for Python 2.7 for Windows and Intel Macs using beta version of numpy 1.5.0.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-04-10 Visual 5.32 released for all platforms. Now
        the 3D text object handles multiline text containing newline characters
        (&quot;\n&quot;), and Kadir Haldenbilen made a 20% speedup in the creation of the
        text object.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-04-02 Visual 5.31 released for all platforms. Kadir
        Haldenbilen made further corrections to the ttfquery and FontTools modules,
        which fixed a variety of errors in rendering 3D text.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-03-30   Visual 5.3 released for all platforms. Thanks
        to great work by Kadir Haldenbilen, there is a new &quot;text&quot; object
        that from any True Type (.ttf) font produces extruded 3D text. This supercedes
        the very limited old visual.text machinery (which however is being left
        in place for upward compatibility). The Windows and Mac versions install
        some font-handling modules that include Polygon, for which the following
        conditions apply:   &quot;Polygon is being distributed subject to the following
        conditions: This distribution contains code from the GPC Library,
        and/or code resulting from the use of the GPC Library. This usage has
        been authorized by The University of Manchester, on the understanding
        that the GPC-related features are used only in the context of this distribution.
        It is not permitted to extract the GPC code from the distribution as
        the basis for commercial exploitation, unless a GPC Commercial Use Licence
        is obtained from The University of Manchester, contact: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/gpc/&quot;.
        There are new faces functions make_normals() and make_twosided(), and
        you can now specify your own criterion for smooth(). The gcurve object
        for making graphs now has an option &quot;dot=True&quot; that highlights
        the currently plotted point on the curve. Some minor bugs were fixed
        in faces, points, and helix.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-02-17 Gary Pajer pointed out that numpy 1.4.0 had been withdrawn, so Visual 5.24 for Windows and for Mac were built to use numpy 1.3.0 instead.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-02-03 Mirko Bordignon fixed a bug in the Mac build
        procedure that made Visual 5.22 not work on OSX 10.5. Visual 5.23 for
        the Mac should work on OSX 10.4 or later.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-01-28 Thanks to work by Mirko Bordignon on threading
        problems, Visual 5.21 released for the Mac, which may address problems
        seen on the Mac with VPython refusing to start. It was discovered that
        5.21 didn't work on OSX 10.5, so Mirko rebuilt the Boost libraries on
        OSX 10.5 and verified that VPython would then work on both 10.5 and 10.6,
        and a Visual
        5.22 installer was released based on these libraries.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2010-01-26 Visual 5.2 released for Windows, Mac, and
        Linux includes new faces function &quot;smooth()&quot; which averages
        similar normals at shared vertices to make an object look smoother. See
        faces documentation. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-12-23 Visual 5.14 released for Windows for any version
        of Python 2.6. This fixes a problem that until the development of Boost
        1.41 it was not possible to build an installer for Visual that worked
        with Python 2.6.4. Visual 5.14 is otherwise identical to Visual 5.13.
        Work is proceeding to deal with the same problem on Macintosh (work completed
        2010-01-23, thanks to help from Mirko Bordignon). For Linux, simply use
      Boost 1.41 to build Visual.</p>
<p class="Normal">2009-10-13 Visual 5.13 released for Windows (Python 2.6),
        Mac (Python 2.6, Intel, OSX 10.4 and above), and Linux. Bugs fixed on Linux
        concerned with making windows visible and invisible, and with reporting
        correct values of scene.x, scene.y, scene.width, and scene.height. Bugs
        fixed on all platforms: vector.mag now is ordinary number instead of
        numpy.ndarray; helix.color is (red,green,blue) instead of an array (the
        array of colors in the helical curve is helix.helix.color); corrected
        documentation error which erroneously claimed that that you couldn't
        specify a list of points for   gcurve, gvbars, or ghbars; error in VIDLE
        corrected by Guilherme Polo -- sometimes initially scrolled so that
        the first line was not visible.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-08-21 Visual 5.12 released for Windows (Python 2.6),
        Mac (Python 2.6, Intel, OSX 10.4 and 10.5), and Linux. New: frame_to_world
        and world_to_frame functions for converting between frame and &quot;world&quot;
        coordinates, stimulated by a suggestion of Robert Xiao. Fixes: bug in
        frame manipulations (pointed out by Robert Xiao), bug in helix that didn't
        permit creating additional attributes when creating a helix. There are
        significant improvements to VIDLE thanks to Guilherme Polo, including
        the ability to edit and test without first saving a file, and the shell
        window coming forward when there is an error, to alert you. The VIDLE
        startup icon on the Mac (in /Applications/VPython) has been simplified
        and is probably more robust.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-06-19 Visual 5.11 released for Windows (Python 2. 5 and 2.6 ), Mac (Python 2.6, Intel and PowerPC, OSX 10.4 and 10.5), and Linux. Not yet released for Mac with Python 2.5. Visual 5.11 fixes a minor bug in the handling of arrow attributes fixedwidth, shaftwidth, headwidth, and headlength to make behavior consistent with Visual 3. The  documentation on these arrow attributes has been made clearer.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-05-15 Visual 5.1 for Python 2.6 released for Windows, Mac, and Linux. David Scherer provided crucial help for getting Visual to work on Python 2.6. Visual 5.1 includes formerly missing features of Visual 3, including right-button and middle-button mouse event handling. Visual 5 provides the basic mouse event functionality that was present in Visual 3 for handling events from right and middle buttons when userspin or userzoom is disabled, out of concern for supporting old programs. However, it has become evident that there are limitations to this approach which could preclude some kinds of mouse handling that people might want to do in the future. For example, you might want to allow userspin with right drags yet also pick up right clicks. For that reason it is conceivable that future developments in this area might break existing programs, and therefore for maximum forward compatibility it is prudent to use only left-button interactions in new programs.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-03-27 Release of VIDLE, an alternative to IDLE which
        fixes some long-standing problems; David Scherer, assisted by Bruce Sherwood.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-01-20 Visual 5.03 for all platforms
         incorporates a fix to handling keyboard events proposed by CL Cheung
        after his careful analysis of a deadlock condition.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2009-01-17 Visual 5.02 for all platforms incorporates
        corrections made by CL Cheung: fixing a bug associated with changing
        the opacity of an object in a frame, and, on Windows, changing some details
        of mouse handling which affected docking/undocking operations in the
        wxpython context. Tests of the frame bug which failed on Windows did
        not fail on Mac or Ubuntu, but the fix has been incorporated anyway,
        as there really was a bug in the code.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-12-31 Visual 5.01 for Linux corrects an error in the size attribute of the points object. New documentation of size and shape attributes for graphing gdots. Package now includes threadpool files.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-12-30 Visual 5.01 for Windows and Mac corrects an error in the size attribute of the points object. New documentation of size and shape attributes for graphing gdots.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-12-8 Release of Visual 5.0 by David Scherer and
        Bruce Sherwood: opacity, local lights, materials such as wood. Includes
        for the first time a native-mode version for the Mac.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-06-20 John Armstrong contributed an easy-to-use installer for VPython
        3.2.11 for Intel Macs running OS X 10.5 (Leopard). </p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-03-10 A major redesign for Visual-4 Beta is
          underway. The central goal of the new design is to create an architecture
          which is more robust, easier to maintain and to extend, and easier
          to install and to use. The principal architects are David Scherer and
          Bruce Sherwood. Steve Spicklemire and Ruth Chabay have also been involved
          in discussions. As a result, a number of changes to the current beta
          version are likely. Support for textures will change. Rather than creating
          a texture bitmap, a programmer will be able to specify a material (such
          as wood). Transparency will be supported. At this point it is unclear
          exactly what support there will be for bitmapped images; they may be
          supported only as &quot;decals&quot; which
        can be applied to flat surfaces. Lighting options may change; it is likely
        that spotlights will not be supported at first in this version. You can
        look forward to higher-quality rendering of scenes on computers with
        modern graphics cards. A Macintosh version which does not require X11
        or Fink will be created. Both the Windows version and the Mac version
        will no longer depend on the large GTK libraries, which will however
        still be the foundation for Linux. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-02-13 4.beta26 for Windows and Linux: This addresses a problem
        in Windows Vista in which there could be a two-minute freeze on a label
        object. It is possible the problem is still present in reduced form,
        with this freeze happening only the first time you use the new software;
        reports from Vista users would be helpful. This package includes much
        enhanced documentation on what is required for a developer to build Visual
        4 on Windows and Mac. Some of this documentation may be of interest to
        Linux users because of the details given concerning library dependencies. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-01-23 4.beta25 for Windows and Linux: Fixed
          not being able to close the window while waiting for scene.mouse.getclick()
          or in a very tight, nearly empty loop. Curves, points, and faces now
          accept color arrays that are either red-green-blue or red-green-blue-opacity.
          Fixed bugs in helix object. Implemented stereo mode &ldquo;crosseyed&rdquo; (all
        stereo modes now implemented).</p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-01-13 4.beta24 for Windows and Linux: For
          the new points object, remove the &quot;antialias&quot; attribute and create a shape attribute
        (currently &quot;round&quot; or &quot;square&quot;). Updated the summary
        of the features in the beta version. Added mandelbrot.py to examples,
        to show how to do pixel-oriented graphing. Fixed a bug which prevented
        specifying a color array in a curve or points constructor.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2008-01-04 4.beta23 for Windows and Linux: Significant speed-up in rendering
        of boxes and curves. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2007-12-31 4.beta22 for Windows and Linux: Fixed bug that made the rendering
        of spheres very slow. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2007-12-25 4.beta21 for Windows and Linux: Default window now 600x600,
        which includes titlebar, toolbar, and borders. Now display max 10000
        points of a curve (old Visual did max 1000). Implement and document curve.retain=N,
        meaning retain only the N most recently appended points. Improved tuning
        of balance between computational thread and render thread. Implemented
        toolbar option to restore to standard values center, forward, and up.
        Documentation for new display.get_titlebar_height(), display.get_toolbar_height().
        Added rate statements to tictac.py, hanoi.py, and toroid_drag.py as a
        workaround for a problem with quitting a program with a loop that contains
        very little computation. The statement scene.show_rendertime = True triggers
        a display in the bottom left corner of the screen of the cycle time (milliseconds
        between rendering of the scene) and render time (milliseconds required
        to render the scene). The cycle time minus the render time is the approximate
        number of milliseconds in the cycle devoted to your Python computations.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2007-11-10 4.beta20 for Windows: Eliminate almost all Windows-specific
        code in favor of gtk2, so that the source code for Visual is nearly universal
        across all platforms. This version works at least as well as 4.beta16
        but does not address all issues on Windows. The version number was advanced
        from 4.beta16 to 4.beta20 as a marker that this represents a major change.</p>

      <p class="Normal">2007-07-06 4.beta16 for Windows and Linux: Fixed a bug with faces, introduced
        in 4.beta15. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2007-04-27 4.beta15 for Windows and Linux: Michael Temkine fixed some
        bugs, added new lighting to boxes, implemented keyboard input for Windows,
        and added boxlighttest.py to the example programs. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-12-30 4.beta14 for Windows and Linux (some of these were corrected
        in 4.beta12 and 4.beta13): Corrects width of arrows, positioning of cones,
        compatibility of old and new formats for specifying lighting, and putting
        a helix in a frame.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-12-11 4.beta11 for Windows: Arthur Siegel fixes bugs which made
        quitting a program error-prone on Windows. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-12-02 4.beta10: Graphing is now as fast as it was in Visual 3. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-12-02 4.beta9: Changes to make graphing go much faster, though
        still not as fast as Visual 3 unless the axes are fixed.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-11-30 4.beta8: Thanks to Arthur Siegel, this beta version uses
        the new numpy, eliminating dependence on Numeric, which is no longer
        supported.The Windows installer will install numpy if it is not already
        installed.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-10-10 Version 3.2.10 for Python 2.5 for Windows. Essentially no
        change from 3.2.9, but runs on the now standard Python 2.5. There is
        also at sourceforge.net a beta version 4.beta7 for Python 2.5 on Windows.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-08-10 4.beta5: Fixed many bugs. Documentation now included, including
        a description of remaining known bugs, some of which are serious. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-08-06 4.beta4: Improvements to scene viewing
          and autoscaling, including hysteresis that prevents fibrillation, where
          the camera jitters in and out. The hysteresis feature can be seen by
          running the example program bounce.py. It used to be that the camera
          zoomed in and out as the ball bounced up and down, but now the camera
          stays rock steady. Everywhere you can now use &quot;opacity&quot; 
        instead of &quot;alpha&quot;. Graph and stonehenge now work. Labels still
        problematic on Windows. Also still true that rings have fixed radius
        and setting axis other than in x direction makes mouse coordinates wrong.
        Arrows still get picked by mousing far from the arrow.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-07-30 Significant restructuring of the beta version (now 4.beta3):
        simplified scaling and viewing; various bugs fixed. Known remaining bugs:
        Rings have fixed radius, and setting axis other than in x direction has
        side effect of making mouse coordinates wrong. Arrows get picked by mousing
        far from the arrow. Labels not working at all well on Windows. Graphing
        not finished, though it works if x and y axes are comparable in scale.
        Mouse handling buggy (e.g. in stonehenge example rotation is way too
        fast; right drag and rotate are commingled). Some view stuff still not
        quite right (move in toward stonehenge and the front disappears too soon).</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-06-01 Beta test version 4.beta1 created by
          Jonathan Brandmeyer with major enhancements: surface textures, transparency,
          sophisticated lighting. It also offers a new points object useful for
          plotting data and a working 
        &quot;visible&quot; attribute for frames that governs all objects in
        the frame. </p>
      <p class="Normal">Here is a <strong><a href="../contents3/index3.html">historical archive describing VPython 3</a></strong>.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-03-02 Version 3.2.9: Corrects a bug in the
          helix object (initial specification of an axis didn't treat the length
          properly) and in the faces object (didn't 
        &quot;broadcast&quot; a single vector across all normals). Improved documentation
        of label and of stereo options.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-02-14 Version 3.2.8: Corrects a bug in histograms (visual.graph);
        didn't handle negative x values. Corrects a missing reference to GLU
        for Linux installers.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-02-12 Version 3.2.7: Corrects a bug in sliders (visual.controls)
        in the case that the minimum value is nonzero. Improves the documentation
        on dragging objects with the mouse.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2006-01-29 Version 3.2.6: Corrects an error in the plotting of the last
        portion of a many-point curve (introduced in version 3.2.4). Curves with
        more than 1024 data points are now rendered by 1024 displayed points
        spread uniformly across all the data points, whereas in the past for
        example 1026 data points were rendered by 513 displayed points.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2005-12-20 Version 3.2.5: Restores missing component of (optional) numarray
        module; corrects spelling in documentation of display.get_selected();
        uses this feature in graph.py rather than the old kludge of creating
        an invisible sphere to save and restore the currently selected display
        when creating a gdisplay object.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2005-12-19 Version 3.2.4 fixes the following errors:<br />
        1) curve now always plots final point (so there isn't a gap at the end),<br />
        2) diff_angle(a,b) is 0 if either a.mag or b.mag is 0 instead of pi/2
        (one could argue that it should be an error, or NaN, &quot;not a number&quot;,
        but making the result zero is consistent with norm(vector(0,0,0)) is
        also zero),<br />
        3) frame documentation changed to explain that frame.objects list only
        visible objects,<br />
        4) makes display.exit = False again work (only a single graphics window closes
        when you click its close box).</p>
      <p class="Normal">2005-05-10 Version 3.2.0 fixes known errors except that ESC does not
        quit the special full-screen mode (scene.fullscreen = True). This also introduces
        the new feature scene.stereo = 'crosseyed', which is like 'passive' but
        places the view for the left eye on the right (and vice versa).</p>
      <p class="Normal">2004-07-22 Jonathan Brandmeyer releases major restructuring of VPython;
        connection between Python and Visual now uses the Boost libraries rather
        than the old CXX mechanism. There is a new built-in object, helix, and
        it is used in a new, very fast version of the demo program crystal.py.
        There is a new __copy()__ routine for copying objects; it replaces the
        old __members__ attribute. There are two new functions to use with vectors:
        vec1.diff_angle(vec2) returns the angle (in radians) between vectors
        vec1 and vec2. You can convert a vector to a tuple by tuple(vec1) or
        by the much faster option vec1.as_tuple(). Its known errors are that
        in full stereo mode (redcyan, shutter glasses, etc.) the graphics windows
        is sometimes all black. There was also a report of graphs not working
        on some machines.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-10-05 Implement greenmagenta stereo, contributed by Bruce Sherwood.
        Rob Salgado pointed out that LCD projectors polarize green horizontally
        (horizontal electric field) and red and blue vertically. This mode therefore
        may be useful for LCD projection with passive polarizing glasses oriented
        to pass horizontal electric field to the left eye and vertical electric
        field to the right eye. (But note that often polarizing stereo glasses
        pass electric field at 45 and 135 degrees, not 0 and 90 degrees.)</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-10-04 Change redcyan and yellowblue stereo to display in color.
        The colors are 50% unsaturated to ensure that there is some signal in
        the views for both eyes. Contributed by Bruce Sherwood. Thanks to Rob
        Salgado for suggesting this capability.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-10-01 Major bug fixed by Jonathan Brandmeyer; typically caused
        problems with graphing. Locking/unlocking resources in the case of changing
        obj.visible was inconsistent between the main Visual thread and the render
        thread.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-09-21 New installer for Linux/Unix that goes with either Python
        2.2 or Python 2.3. If installed to accompany Python 2.3, it uses the
        new IDLE that comes with Python 2.3. Thanks to Jonathan Brandmeyer.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-09-18 Finish implementation of redblue, redcyan, yellowblue stereo
        modes begun by John Zelle; Bruce Sherwood. Linux/Unix/MacOSX version
        available 9/20.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-09-14 Add ellipsoid object, contributed by Shaun Press.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-09-04 Add support for stereo displays, contributed by John Zelle.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-08-10 Windows installer to accompany Python 2.3. This does not
        include IDLE for VPython, because its capabilities are provided by the
        new IDLE component of Python 2.3.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-06-27 Add pyramid object, contributed by Shaun Press, and fullscreen
        display option, contributed by Hugh Fisher. Also add color.orange.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2003-03-29 New self-configuring installer by Jonathan Brandmeyer for
        Linux/Unix/Mac OSX. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2002-07-22 Add fixedwidth attribute to arrow object; turns off scaling
        of very short or very long arrows.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2002-07-07 Add mag2 function to vectors; if V.mag is 5, V.mag2 is 25.</p>
