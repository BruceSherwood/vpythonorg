<H3>Brief history of cT</H3>
<p>The cT programming language was developed in the period 1985-2000 in the Center 
  for Design of Educational Computing at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh 
  (the Center was later renamed the Center for Innovation in Learning; it ceased 
  operation in 2002). The developers were David Andersen, Bruce Sherwood, Judith 
  Sherwood, and Kevin Whitley. The initial impetus was the need for an easy to 
  use graphics- and mouse-oriented programming environment for faculty and students 
  using the then-new &quot;3M&quot; Unix workstations (a million bytes of memory, 
  a million pixels, and a million instruction per second). </p>
<p>Ease of use was important because the alternative, writing in C and using highly 
  complex graphics libraries, was beyond the capabilities of most users. Another 
  issue was that at that time the windowing software was changing rapidly, so 
  that programs written in C that used graphics or the mouse quickly became obsolete. 
  Moreover, it soon became clear that not everyone would use Unix workstations, 
  thanks to the increasing capabilities of the popular microcomputers, especially 
  Macintosh and IBM PC. This put a premium on cross-platform executability of 
  graphics programs, which C did not offer but cT did.</p>
<p>cT was based on earlier languages used by the authors of computer-based educational
  materials written for the PLATO computer-based education system developed at
  the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. cT is a granddaughter of the
  TUTOR language initiated in 1967, and a daughter of the MicroTutor language
  initiated in 1977. cT differs from the earlier dialects in being designed for
  the modern graphical user interface (windows and mouse). Here is a reproduction
  of the textbook <a href="The_TUTOR_Language_1977.pdf">The TUTOR Language</a> written
  in 1977 by Bruce Sherwood.</p>
<p>cT was used for a variety of purposes, but its main niche was the creation 
  of programs for education. Many prize-winning educational programs were written 
  in cT, especially in the area of physics.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1997 Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood taught cT to students in 
  an introductory physics class at Carnegie Mellon, and students used cT to model 
  physical systems with graphical animations of system behavior. Thanks to its 
  ease of use, it was possible in a mere hour or two to teach an adequate subset 
  of cT to students for the purposes of the physics course, even for the many 
  students who had never written a computer program before.</p>
<p>This approach was repeated in the fall of 1998. In the course was a freshman 
  computer science student named David Scherer. In the following year he was looking 
  for an interesting project to work on and proposed creating an alternative programming 
  environment for students to use in the physics course. His hope was to make 
  the programming even easier for novices, yet make it feasible for them to create 
  real-time navigable 3D animations, whereas cT offered only 2D graphics. Assisted 
  by David Andersen, Ruth Chabay, Ari Heitner, Ian Peters, and Bruce Sherwood, 
  in the spring and summer of 2000 Scherer produced the VPython programming environment 
  which was deployed in the fall 2000 physics course. The clear superiority of 
  VPython with its easy to use object-oriented 3D graphics led to the decision 
  to stop development of cT and concentrate on VPython.</p>
<p>Archived here are versions of the cT programming environment for Windows, Macintosh, 
  and Linux, plus the public-domain source code for these environments. No support 
  is currently available for these materials, but you are free to do whatever 
  you like with them.</p>

<P><b>It would not be prudent to start using cT now, when it is no longer being 
  supported. The following materials are made available as an archive with historical 
  interest.</b> 
<P>There are many excellent applications available for creating pictures and diagrams, 
  and for making multimedia presentations, without having to write your own computer 
  program. <BR>
  <BR>
  However, it is sometimes the case that doing something really new and different 
  is hard to do with these non-programming applications, because they often don't 
  provide enough control of interactions and enough calculational capability to 
  do what you really want to do. <BR>
  <BR>
  cT offers the open-ended flexibility and power associated with programming languages 
  but eliminates many of the difficulties and complexities usually associated 
  with using a programming language.<BR>

<H3><A name="SamplePrograms"></A>Sample Programs Included with cT 3.0</H3>
<P>Here are descriptions of the cT programs available from the cT download page 
  to give you&nbsp; ideas for your own work:</P>
<H4>General</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>sample</B> -- This program is a sampler of many of the basic 
  capabilities of cT: color graphics, animations, pull-down menus, mouse clicks 
  and drags, multi-font text, "hot" text, calculations, graphing of functions, 
  and response analysis. After running the program you might want to study the 
  program code to see how the effects are achieved. 
  <LI><B>exercise</B> -- A set of exercises to help you learn the basic concepts 
  of programming in cT. The program contains a number of incomplete units with 
  suggestions on how to complete them. The cT help contains the information 
  needed to do these exercises. 
  <LI><B>editfile</B> -- A more complex version of the example discussed in "A 
  File Editor Application". The editfile.t version reads and writes styled files 
  containing multiple sections (that is, created with multiple dataout-s). 
  <LI><B>showicon</B> -- A program that displays the icons in an icon file. This 
  can be useful in selecting icon numbers for use in a plot, move, cursor, or 
  pattern command. 
  <LI><B>icon</B> -- A program for designing icons, cursors, and patterns, 
  except on the Macintosh, for which the program Icon Maker is supplied. 
  <LI><B>japan</B> -- This program displays Japanese "Kanji" characters, using a 
  set of icons "KANJI18.FCT". </LI></UL>
<H4>Graphics</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>draw</B> -- A basic drawing editor, with many of the features of 
  commercial drawing editors, such as grouping objects together, applying 
  patterns, colors, and arrowheads, and designing your own palette of colors. 
  Drawings are saved in the form of cT source code, so you may find draw.t 
  useful in creating portions of your own programs, including color palette 
  commands. This program also illustrates one approach to "object-oriented" 
  programming in cT. 
  <LI><B>map</B> -- A little program which displays a map of the 48 contiguous 
  states of the United States, with an ability to zoom in and out. </LI></UL>
<H4>Color</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>palette</B> -- A use file which provides a set of useful additional 
  colors beyond the basic eight cT colors, including dark red, dark green, and 
  light, regular, and dark versions of slate, teal, coral, gray, gold, lavender, 
  and cerise. 
  <LI><B>setcolor</B> -- A use file which lets you experiment with the color of 
  an object, in the full context of your running program. This is useful for 
  deciding exactly what color the object should be in relationship to other 
  elements of your display. 
  <LI><B>chaos</B> -- A plot of the chaos in a simple population growth scheme. 
  Usually what is plotted is just the final-state population. This program uses 
  hues from blue to red to show the approach to the final state. The red dots 
  correspond to the usual plot. 
  <LI><B>spiro</B> -- Make geometrical color designs by choosing the total 
  number of vertices and the number of vertices to skip. It uses the use-file 
  colorpic.t. </LI></UL>
<H4>Video</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>video</B> -- A program which gives an example of how to build your own 
  special-purpose video controller, using the basic video commands. This file 
  can be used as a use file by other programs. A short video clip for testing 
  purposes is provided for Macintosh and Windows. </LI></UL>
<H4>Games</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>BigForty</B> -- A solitaire card game which uses touch regions, so that 
  event-handling routines are driven automatically; there are no pause commands 
  in the program. The program uses the use file animate to provide the option of 
  sliding cards smoothly over the background on sufficiently fast computers. 
  <LI><B>rilato</B> -- A Mah Jong-like game in which you match corresponding 
  pairs of tiles. Pairs can be chemical elements and their symbols, American 
  presidents and their years in office, English kings and their years of reign, 
  or American states and their capital cities. You can also create your own 
  lists of pairs. </LI></UL>
<H4>Physics and Math</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>grapher</B> -- Solves and graphs systems of algebraic or ordinary 
  differential equations. This program was a first prize winner in the 1990 
  Educational Software Contest of the journal <EM>Computers in Physics</EM> 
  (Sept./Oct. 1990, p. 540). The program includes an interactive explanation of 
  how to use the program. 
  <LI><B>hill</B> -- Draw a hill with the mouse, place a block on the hill, give 
  it an initial speed, and watch it move. If there is a valley, the block may 
  move back and forth forever (no friction), or slowly come to rest (if you add 
  some friction with the slider control). While the block moves, bar graphs 
  display the kinetic, potential, and total energy. At the beginning of the 
  program, the program makes a measurement to determine the animation step size, 
  so the animation runs at about the same speed on fast and slow computers. 
  <LI><B>orbit</B> -- Launch a satellite near two stationary "earths," and watch 
  the unusual orbits that result. At the end of the file is a 4th-order 
  Runge-Kutta numerical integration procedure which may be useful in other 
  contexts. 
  <LI><B>optics</B> -- Place lens and mirrors along a bench, then flash a light. 
  Rays spread out and are bent by the optical elements, producing a spot on a 
  piece of film. There is an interactive explanation of how to use the program. 
  <LI><B>quantumw</B> -- Study the quantum behavior of an electron in various 
  kinds of potential wells. If the well is symmetrical, the bound states have 
  symmetrical wave functions. 
  <LI><B>sonar</B> and <EM>voltage</EM> -- Simple examples of 
  microcomputer-based-laboratory software. Connect a Universal Lab Interface 
  (ULI) and Sonic Ranger (distributed by Vernier Software of Portland, Oregon, 
  phone 503-297-5317) to the serial port of either a Macintosh or an MS-DOS 
  machine, and <EM>sonar</EM> will track your motion in front of the motion 
  detector. If you don't have this equipment, use the mouse to make motions that 
  are graphed on the screen. The program <EM>voltage</EM> uses the ULI to plot 
  voltage as a function of time. 
  <LI><B>xyplot</B> -- Plot a function of two variables, f(x,y), using a set of 
  icons of differing dot densities (icon file random). </LI></UL>
<H4>Inter-computer programs using sockets</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>InterDraw</B> -- Run this program on two different Macintoshes in the 
  same AppleTalk zone, or two different Unix workstations on the same network 
  (provided that a cT server has been established), and two people can draw on 
  each other's screens, or run two copies of the program on one Unix 
  workstation. This program is a simple example of the use of the socket command 
  to link separate programs together. 
  <LI><B>Battleship</B> -- The classic "battleship" game played on two different 
  Macintoshes in the same AppleTalk zone, or two networked Unix workstations 
  (provided that a cT server has been established). This is another example of 
  the use of the socket command. It also provides another example of how to do 
  object-oriented programming in cT. The program uses the icons file SHIPicn.
