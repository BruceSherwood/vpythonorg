<H3 align=center>The cT  Programming Language and Environment</H3>
<H3 align=left>Important announcement about Python</H3>
<P>We have an important announcement to make about the <A 
href="http://cil.andrew.cmu.edu/ct.html#Overview">cT</A> programming language 
that we have been developing in the Center for Innovation in Learning at 
Carnegie Mellon University. We will continue to provide a certain level of 
support for cT for some time, but we are now turning our attention to developing 
a new programming environment, by adding 3D graphics to the Python programming 
language. We hope that eventually this can be a replacement for cT, but there is 
a lot of work required to get there.</P>
<P>Python is a powerful programming language invented by Guido van Rossum about 
ten years ago. Superficially Python resembles cT, in that there are few 
extraneous brackets, etc., and loops and ifs have required indenting. Here are 
equivalent subroutines to calculate a factorial in cT and in Python:</P>
<P>unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; factorial(x; product)&nbsp;&nbsp; $$ 
cT<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; f: x, 
product<BR>calc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product := x<BR>loop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x 
&gt; 1<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
calc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x := 
x-1<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
product := product*x<BR>endloop</P>
<P>def factorial(x):&nbsp;&nbsp; # Python; note that there is no need to define 
variables<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product = 
x<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while x &gt; 
1:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
x = 
x-1<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
product = product*x<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 
product</P>
<P>Python is quite different from cT in being object-oriented. As is the case 
with cT, it is easy to start writing simple programs in Python, and even using 
classes and objects involves a relatively gentle learning curve. Python is 
cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). It is open source (and therefore free) and 
supported by a sizable developer community. The user community though small in 
comparison with the users of C is quite large compared to the cT user community. 
Python is a general-purpose language, though a very common use of Python is for 
the same kinds of application for which Perl is used, to manage servers, 
administer systems, etc. There is an extensive web site, <A 
href="http://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</A>. A good textbook is 
"Learning Python" by Mark Lutz and David Ascher, O’Reilly 1999.</P>
<P>Python itself does not provide graphics output, though it is possible to do 
2D graphics using the Tk graphics library (this is difficult however and really 
intended only for expert programmers). Recently David Scherer, a sophomore in 
computer science at Carnegie Mellon, created a 3D graphics module for Python, 
called "Visual", that is exceptionally easy to use; the combination of Python 
with Visual is called <A 
href="http://virtualphoton.pc.cc.cmu.edu/projects/visual/">VPython</A>. Suppose 
you want to write a program that calculates and displays the Earth orbiting the 
Sun. You create two spheres and name them "Earth" and "Sun". Then in a loop, one 
instant after another, you compute the new positions of the Earth, without 
writing any graphics output statements. Visual, running in parallel to your 
program, watches the current values of your Earth object and automatically 
updates a 3D scene of the Earth and Sun. This allows you to focus on the 
computational aspects and leave completely to VPython the difficult task of 
making a corresponding display in three dimensions.</P>
<P>Moreover, with no programming effort on your part, you can use the mouse to 
navigate in the 3D scene, looking at the scene from different points of view 
while the program is running.</P>
<P>As an added bonus, VPython supports not only graphics objects such as spheres 
and boxes and arrows but also full vector arithmetic. You can add or subtract 
vectors, multiply them by scalars, take dot and cross products, etc. This makes 
it much easier (and faster) to deal with vector quantitties. Often one writes a 
single vector statement rather than two or three vector component 
statements.</P>
<P>Some physics students at Carnegie Mellon used cT to do computer modeling (see 
<A 
href="http://cil.andrew.cmu.edu/mi.html">http://cil.andrew.cmu.edu/mi.html</A>). 
Students are now using VPython&nbsp; instead, because we see big advantages to 
being able to focus better on the physics computations (without graphics 
statements), with 3D visualization, and with the possibility of doing true 
vector rather than component calculations.</P>
<P>The Python language itself is cross-platform, but not with respect to 
graphics. VPython works on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh (though some of the 
nice editing features available for Windows and Linux do not yet work on the 
Macintosh version).</P>
<P>You might ask, why not build Visual on top of cT rather than on top of 
Python? The answer is basically that because cT is not object-oriented, it would 
be essentially impossible to do this. We think the advantages are so compelling 
that we have moved from cT to VPython.</P>
<P>We are also encouraged in this move by the fact that Guido van Rossum himself 
has become very interested in what he calls "Programming for Everybody" (see 
essay at www.python.org). Until recently Python was used mostly by expert 
professional programmers. Guido believes (correctly, in our judgement) that 
Python could make it possible for novice programmers to write useful programs, 
and he wants to address the many difficulties that novice programmers face. cT 
has attempted to support nonprofessional programmers, and we continue to be 
interested in this challenge.</P>
<P>The VPython group at Carnegie Mellon has consisted of computer science 
students David Scherer, Ari Heitner, and Ian Peters, and Center for Innovation 
in Learning personnel David Andersen, Ruth Chabay, and Bruce Sherwood. In 
addition to work on Visual itself, the group has addressed various issues to 
make Python easy to use by novice programmers. Significant improvements have 
been made in installation procedures and in "Idle," the integrated Python 
editing and testing environment.</P>
<P>At present, VPython offers 3D graphics but does not offer everything that cT 
offers, including buttons, sliders, and edit panels. One of the thrusts of our 
future work is to bring these capabilities to VPython , in an easy-to-use form, 
based on our experience with cT. In the long run we would hope that 
nonprofessional programmers will be able to create in VPython the kinds of 
applications for which they have used cT in the past.</P>
<P>As far as support for cT is concerned, we expect to maintain cT for some 
time, to the extent of fixing serious bugs and/or getting cT to run on new 
versions of operating systems, but we don’t intend to add new features to cT. At 
this time it is an open question whether we can provide in the VPython 
environment capabilities comparable to those currently available in cT. If we 
can do this, at some point we will stop supporting cT. If someone else would 
like to take over support and development of cT, we would be happy to assist in 
a transfer of technology and responsibility.</P>

Sherwood</P>

<H3><A name=Tool></A>When is cT the right tool?</H3>
<P>There are many excellent applications available for creating pictures and 
diagrams, and for making multimedia presentations, without having to write your 
own computer program. <BR><BR>However, it is sometimes the case that doing 
something really new and different is hard to do with these non-programming 
applications, because they often don't provide enough control of interactions 
and enough calculational capability to do what you really want to do. <BR><BR>cT 
offers the open-ended flexibility and power associated with programming 
languages but eliminates many of the difficulties and complexities usually 
associated with using a programming language.<BR><BR>

<H3><A name="Sample Programs"></A>Sample Programs Included with cT 3.0</H3>
<P>Here are descriptions of the cT programs <A 
href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/33-131/getct.htm">available in source 
form</A> to give you&nbsp; ideas for your own work:</P>
<H4>General</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>sample</B> -- This program is a sampler of many of the basic 
  capabilities of cT: color graphics, animations, pull-down menus, mouse clicks 
  and drags, multi-font text, "hot" text, calculations, graphing of functions, 
  and response analysis. After running the program you might want to study the 
  program code to see how the effects are achieved. 
  <LI><B>exercise</B> -- A set of exercises to help you learn the basic concepts 
  of programming in cT. The program contains a number of incomplete units with 
  suggestions on how to complete them. The cT help contains the information 
  needed to do these exercises. 
  <LI><B>editfile</B> -- A more complex version of the example discussed in "A 
  File Editor Application". The editfile.t version reads and writes styled files 
  containing multiple sections (that is, created with multiple dataout-s). 
  <LI><B>showicon</B> -- A program that displays the icons in an icon file. This 
  can be useful in selecting icon numbers for use in a plot, move, cursor, or 
  pattern command. 
  <LI><B>icon</B> -- A program for designing icons, cursors, and patterns, 
  except on the Macintosh, for which the program Icon Maker is supplied. 
  <LI><B>japan</B> -- This program displays Japanese "Kanji" characters, using a 
  set of icons "KANJI18.FCT". </LI></UL>
<H4>Graphics</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>draw</B> -- A basic drawing editor, with many of the features of 
  commercial drawing editors, such as grouping objects together, applying 
  patterns, colors, and arrowheads, and designing your own palette of colors. 
  Drawings are saved in the form of cT source code, so you may find draw.t 
  useful in creating portions of your own programs, including color palette 
  commands. This program also illustrates one approach to "object-oriented" 
  programming in cT. 
  <LI><B>map</B> -- A little program which displays a map of the 48 contiguous 
  states of the United States, with an ability to zoom in and out. </LI></UL>
<H4>Color</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>palette</B> -- A use file which provides a set of useful additional 
  colors beyond the basic eight cT colors, including dark red, dark green, and 
  light, regular, and dark versions of slate, teal, coral, gray, gold, lavender, 
  and cerise. 
  <LI><B>setcolor</B> -- A use file which lets you experiment with the color of 
  an object, in the full context of your running program. This is useful for 
  deciding exactly what color the object should be in relationship to other 
  elements of your display. 
  <LI><B>chaos</B> -- A plot of the chaos in a simple population growth scheme. 
  Usually what is plotted is just the final-state population. This program uses 
  hues from blue to red to show the approach to the final state. The red dots 
  correspond to the usual plot. 
  <LI><B>spiro</B> -- Make geometrical color designs by choosing the total 
  number of vertices and the number of vertices to skip. It uses the use-file 
  colorpic.t. </LI></UL>
<H4>Video</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>video</B> -- A program which gives an example of how to build your own 
  special-purpose video controller, using the basic video commands. This file 
  can be used as a use file by other programs. A short video clip for testing 
  purposes is provided for Macintosh and Windows. </LI></UL>
<H4>Games</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>BigForty</B> -- A solitaire card game which uses touch regions, so that 
  event-handling routines are driven automatically; there are no pause commands 
  in the program. The program uses the use file animate to provide the option of 
  sliding cards smoothly over the background on sufficiently fast computers. 
  <LI><B>rilato</B> -- A Mah Jong-like game in which you match corresponding 
  pairs of tiles. Pairs can be chemical elements and their symbols, American 
  presidents and their years in office, English kings and their years of reign, 
  or American states and their capital cities. You can also create your own 
  lists of pairs. </LI></UL>
<H4>Physics and Math</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>grapher</B> -- Solves and graphs systems of algebraic or ordinary 
  differential equations. This program was a first prize winner in the 1990 
  Educational Software Contest of the journal <EM>Computers in Physics</EM> 
  (Sept./Oct. 1990, p. 540). The program includes an interactive explanation of 
  how to use the program. 
  <LI><B>hill</B> -- Draw a hill with the mouse, place a block on the hill, give 
  it an initial speed, and watch it move. If there is a valley, the block may 
  move back and forth forever (no friction), or slowly come to rest (if you add 
  some friction with the slider control). While the block moves, bar graphs 
  display the kinetic, potential, and total energy. At the beginning of the 
  program, the program makes a measurement to determine the animation step size, 
  so the animation runs at about the same speed on fast and slow computers. 
  <LI><B>orbit</B> -- Launch a satellite near two stationary "earths," and watch 
  the unusual orbits that result. At the end of the file is a 4th-order 
  Runge-Kutta numerical integration procedure which may be useful in other 
  contexts. 
  <LI><B>optics</B> -- Place lens and mirrors along a bench, then flash a light. 
  Rays spread out and are bent by the optical elements, producing a spot on a 
  piece of film. There is an interactive explanation of how to use the program. 
  <LI><B>quantumw</B> -- Study the quantum behavior of an electron in various 
  kinds of potential wells. If the well is symmetrical, the bound states have 
  symmetrical wave functions. 
  <LI><B>sonar</B> and <EM>voltage</EM> -- Simple examples of 
  microcomputer-based-laboratory software. Connect a Universal Lab Interface 
  (ULI) and Sonic Ranger (distributed by Vernier Software of Portland, Oregon, 
  phone 503-297-5317) to the serial port of either a Macintosh or an MS-DOS 
  machine, and <EM>sonar</EM> will track your motion in front of the motion 
  detector. If you don't have this equipment, use the mouse to make motions that 
  are graphed on the screen. The program <EM>voltage</EM> uses the ULI to plot 
  voltage as a function of time. 
  <LI><B>xyplot</B> -- Plot a function of two variables, f(x,y), using a set of 
  icons of differing dot densities (icon file random). </LI></UL>
<H4>Inter-computer programs using sockets</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><B>InterDraw</B> -- Run this program on two different Macintoshes in the 
  same AppleTalk zone, or two different Unix workstations on the same network 
  (provided that a cT server has been established), and two people can draw on 
  each other's screens, or run two copies of the program on one Unix 
  workstation. This program is a simple example of the use of the socket command 
  to link separate programs together. 
  <LI><B>Battleship</B> -- The classic "battleship" game played on two different 
  Macintoshes in the same AppleTalk zone, or two networked Unix workstations 
  (provided that a cT server has been established). This is another example of 
  the use of the socket command. It also provides another example of how to do 
  object-oriented programming in cT. The program uses the icons file SHIPicn.
