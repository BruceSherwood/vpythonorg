      <p class="Normal"><strong class="style7">HOW PYTHON IS DIFFERENT</strong><br />
        Comments for those with prior programming experience<br />
        Bruce Sherwood, Fall 2006; revised Fall 2009<br />
        (For more formal comparisons, see Google)</p>
      <p class="Normal">In many respects Python is like any other algorithmic programming language
        (C, Pascal, Java, etc.) and unlike, say, Lisp. There are a few features
        of Python that an experienced programmer doesn't expect because they
        are embedded in a seemingly familiar environment yet are quite different
        from most algorithmic languages. This document attempts to point out
        the most important ones.</p>
      <p class="Normal"><strong class="style7">DYNAMIC TYPING</strong><br />
  When you say &quot;z1 = Zork(cost=23)&quot; you create a Zork object
        and stick a label on it, &quot;z1&quot;. There is no need (and no way)
        to declare &quot;z1&quot;  to be of type &quot;Zork&quot; before labeling
        this instance of the class  &quot;Zork&quot; with the label &quot;z1&quot;.</p>
      <p class="Normal">If you now say &quot;z2 = z1&quot; you have not created any new object,
        you have merely stuck a second label &quot;z2&quot; on the existing Zork
        object. Note carefully that this does NOT create a second instance of
        the class  &quot;Zork&quot;. If you alter z1.cost it is just the same
        as altering z2.cost. Making a second, independent copy of an object is
        a fairly unusual thing to do in Python, but there exist special methods
        for doing this.</p>
      <p class="Normal">If you now say &quot;z1 = 3.7&quot; the label &quot;z1&quot; no longer
        refers to the Zork object, and a reference counter on the Zork object
        is decremented. You can still refer to the object with expressions such
        as &quot;z2.cost&quot;. If you then say &quot;z2 = 28.7/3.4&quot; there
        is no longer any way to refer to the Zork object. The Zork object reference
        count is decremented again, to zero, and the object is now marked as
        eligible to be deleted by the garbage collection routine, since there
        is no longer any way to refer to it.</p>
      <p class="Normal">This label behavior only applies to objects that are
        &quot;mutable&quot; (can be changed; see next section). In contrast, if you say
        &quot;a = b = 5&quot; and then say &quot;b = 2&quot;, &quot;a&quot; still has the value 5.</p>
      <p class="Normal">Special case for VPython: Humanly visible objects such as boxes or spheres
        in a graphics scene have an extra reference count so that even if there
        are no labels on these objects, they are not deletable because a human
        viewer counts as a reference. To delete a visual object it is first necessary
        to set the visible attribute to False.</p>
      <p class="Normal"><strong class="style7">MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE</strong><br />
  An important Python structure is a list: mylist = [3, 'dog', 4.7, Zork(cost=23),
          box()]. The 'dog' in this list can be referred to as mylist[1], the
          elements being numbered starting with zero. If you say mylist[1] =
          42 you've changed 'dog' to 42 in the list. The ability to change elements
          in a list means that lists are  &quot;mutable&quot;.</p>
      <p class="Normal">A different list-like structure is a tuple: mytup
          = (3, 'dog', 4.7) is created using parens instead of square brackets.
          You can read an element, so mytup[1] refers to 'dog', but you cannot
          change an element. A tuple is  &quot;immutable&quot;. The only way to achieve the effect is something
        like this:&nbsp; mytup = (mytup[0], 42, mytup[2]), which creates a new
        tuple.</p>
      <p class="Normal">Lists and tuples are examples of what are called &quot;sequences&quot; in
        Python. A third important kind of sequence is a dictionary, which is
        a container of elements with keywords, and you index in not by position
        but by keyword (as a string).</p>
      <p class="Normal"><strong class="style7">&quot;FOR&quot; LOOPS</strong><br />
        A particularly delightful and powerful feature of Python is that you
          can loop over any sequence. Suppose for example you have created objects
          for the planets. You can loop over them like this:</p>
      <p class="Normal">for planet in [Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
        Neptune, Pluto]:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print planet.pos,
  planet.mass, planet.radius</p>
      <p class="Normal">This could also be written like this:</p>
      <p class="Normal">planets = [Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
        Pluto]<br />
        for planet in planets:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print planet.pos,
  planet.mass, planet.radius</p>
      <p class="Normal"><strong class="style7">INTEGER DIVISION</strong><br />
        As in many languages including C, 3/4 normally evaluates as zero rather
          than 0.75. There is a slow migration path for Python eventually to
          treat 3/4 as 0.75 rather than zero. You can invoke this behavior now
          by making the following statement the first statement in the program:</p>
      <p class="Normal">from&nbsp; __future__&nbsp;  import division</p>
      <p class="Normal">Note carefully that there are TWO underlines before &quot;future&quot; and
        TWO underlines after &quot;future&quot;.</p>
      <p class="Normal"><strong class="style7">IDLE VS SHELL</strong><br />
  If you run Python directly, or operate in the &quot;shell&quot; window
        of IDLE, the editor that comes with Python, you can execute statements
        interactively. Many experienced programmers find this a useful mode.</p>
      <p class="Normal">Some people much prefer to write whole programs,
          even small ones, because it is easier to revise and easier to understand
          what state of module import one is in. There are two features in IDLE
          that can be set in the Configure IDLE menu option (if not already set
          at install time) which make edit/compile/run/revise cycles almost as
          immediate as the shell window. One feature is to specify that whenever
          you press F5 to run, the current version of your file is automatically
          saved to disk (&quot;autosave&quot;;
        note that there is nearly infinite un-do available). The other is an
        option to specify that at startup IDLE should open an edit window rather
        than the shell window (you can always open a shell window later, and
        one is created when you run a program, because that's where text output
        goes). The first time you press F5 to run, you will be asked to specify
        where to save the file, but with autosave turned on you won't be asked
        again. </p>
      <p class="Normal">The effect is that when you start IDLE you're ready to enter a program,
        and after the initial save, the programming cycle is extremely simple:
        just press F5 to save and run. One-touch testing.</p>
      <p class="Normal">(As of Fall 2009 the VIDLE variant of IDLE lets you specify
        that you don't need to save the file even the first time. If you exit
        VIDLE without saving the file to a permanent location, you're invited
      to do the save. With this restoration of a feature that used to be present
        in IDLE, you can now write little test routines without the distraction
      of saving the file. It is expected that the standard IDLE distributed with
        future versions of Python will incorporate the recent improvements currently
        available in VIDLE.)</p>
