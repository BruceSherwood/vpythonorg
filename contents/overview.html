      <h3 class="style7">The Python Programming Language</h3>
      <p class="Normal">Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language initiated
        by Guido van Rossum in 1990. It is easy to start writing simple programs
        in Python, and even using classes and objects involves a relatively gentle
        learning curve. Python is cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). It is
        open source (and free) and supported by a sizable developer community.
        Python is a general-purpose programming language with significant numerical
        capabilities, though a common use of Python is managing servers, administering
        systems, etc. See the extensive web site, <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>.
        There are various good textbooks available, as well as tutorials available
        on the web.</p>
      <h3 class="style7">Realtime 3D Graphics: Visual</h3>
      <p class="Normal"><strong>This is documentation for Classic VPython (VPython 6), which continues to be available but is no longer supported. See <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">vpython.org</a> for information on installing VPython 7 or using GlowScript VPython. Documentation is available at <a href="http://www.glowscript.org/" target="_blank">glowscript.org</a> by clicking Help.</strong></p>
      <p class="Normal">Python itself does not provide graphics output. The Tk
        graphics
          library can be used to create 2D graphics, but it is aimed  at very
        experienced programmers and does not support 3D displays. </p>
      <p class="Normal">In the spring of 2000, while a sophomore
        in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, David Scherer created
        a 3D graphics module for Python, called &quot;Visual,&quot; 
        that is exceptionally easy to use. A program can create 3D objects (such
        as spheres, curves, etc.) and position them in 3D space. Visual, running
        in a separate thread, automatically updates a 3D scene many times per
        second, to reflect the current positions of the objects. The programmer
        does not need to deal with display management, but can focus on the computational
        aspects of the program. The user can navigate in the 3D scene by using
        the mouse to zoom and rotate while the program is running. Visual supports
        full vector algebra.</p>
      <p class="Normal">The combination of Python plus the Visual
          module is called &quot;VPython&quot;.
        Visual is also dependent on a numerical array module, numpy.</p>
      <h3 class="style7">Use in Education</h3>
      <p class="Normal">Students in <a href="https://matterandinteractions.org" target="_blank">introductory
          physics courses</a> have been using VPython to do computer modeling.
          VPython lets students focus on the physics computations without having
          to write explicit graphics statements yet obtain 3D visualization.
          Students can do true vector computations, which improves their understanding
          of the utility of vectors and vector notation. Instructors have used
          VPython to create 3D lecture demo programs.</p>
      <h3 class="style7">Use in Research</h3>
      <p class="Normal">Python is widely used in scientific research (see <a href="http://scipy.org" target="_blank">scipy.org</a>).
        VPython has been found useful in research for visualizing
        situations and data in 3D.</p>
      <h3 class="style7">Platforms Supported</h3>
      <p class="Normal">The Python language itself is cross-platform. The Visual
        module, and the IDLE integrated development environment that comes with
        Python, work on Windows and Mac and Unix/Linux. </p>
      <h3 class="style7">Contributors</h3>
      <p class="Normal">The original implementation in the spring of 2000 was
        carried out by a team at Carnegie Mellon University led by David Scherer.
        Scherer did almost all of the coding, but he was aided in various ways
        by David Andersen, Ruth Chabay, Ari Heitner, Ian Peters, and Bruce Sherwood.</p>
      <p class="Normal">Visual 5 was created by David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood.
        Jonathan Brandmeyer provided support in Visual 4beta for opacity, local
        lighting, and textures, and made some important architectural changes,
        but had to stop work on the project before it was completed.  Further
        development has led to API changes which are incompatible with the Visual
        4beta release, so the new release is called version 5 instead of 4.</p>
      <p class="Normal"> The late Arthur Siegel implemented dependence on the
        currently supported numpy library in place of Numeric, which is no longer
        supported. Hugh Fisher provided a big start on the native-mode Mac version.
        Michael Temkine fixed some bugs and implemented keyboard handling for
        Windows.</p>
      <p class="Normal"> Previous to Visual 4beta, Jonathan Brandmeyer made several
        major contributions to Visual 3, including changing the connection between
        Python and C++ from CXX, which was no longer supported, to the Boost
        C++ libraries, and implementing auto-configurable installations for Linux.</p>
      <p class="Normal">Others who have contributed significant code to the Visual
        module include Shawn Press and John Zelle.
        See <a href="history.html">&quot;Recent developments&quot;</a> for
        details. </p>
      <h3 class="style7">Published Articles</h3>
      <p class="Normal">A journal article about VPython has been published:</p>
